# SEF FaceBook Live Technical guidelines
### The equipments you would need for a FB Live Broadcast.
1. A Computer or a Laptop

* If you are using a  **Laptop** then you can use **inbuilt webcam and the microphone**.
2. Internet Connection
* You would be needing **a good internet connection** since fast upload speed is important for an uninterrupted broadcast of the live video.

### Tools or Software required for a FB Live Broadcast.

* If you are going to conduct the Live Broadcast **without any slides**, then you could **directly go live** on Facebook using your web browser.(We highly recommend Google Chrome).

* If you have any **slides or any third party content** like videos,photos and etc to present during the live broadcast, then you would be needing a live broadcasting tool that allows you to share your screen.(we recommend **[OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)** which is available on both Windows and Mac). 

* You can follow this **[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rapsYGqHsUA)** for step by step guidance on live streaming using OBS Studio.
